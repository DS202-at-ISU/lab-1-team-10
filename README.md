# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

This is a line from RStudio Cael L: Step 12.3 went smoothly, and I was
able to get the github repository to load into RStudio successfully.

Cael L. Step 12.4: The main problem I was having with committing changes
to github it would set back the version of the READ.ME file in RStudio
and it wouldn’t allow me to enter visual mode. I was able to fix this
problem by deleting any information that RStudio didn’t know and it
allowed me to commit messages.
